-Unable to build with Visual Studio. Some linker errors.
-Use WSL with XMing instead.
-Edit glx_context.c, it checks for GLX version 1.3. Don't return GL_FALSE, just let error be

-world2Cam was a bit tricky to implement: the lookAt vector is relative to world origin,
so to get the camera's lookAt, we need to minus the camera pos. This was different in MIT's implementation
-forgot to do that when creating world2ShadowLight matrices as well.

-Turns out model view matrices are world2X matrices. Model-view-projection (MVP) matrices are:
PerspectiveProjection * World2View * Model2World. (but not yet homogenize)

-world2LightNDC (aka MVP for shadow-casting lights) are in OpenGL NDC [-1, 1] (after perspective divide from clip space [-w, w])
and we needed to make them [0, 1] for shadow texture look-up. Made a mistake of division here,
should just use w (by setting component of w to 1) and scale by 0.5. Remember to concat with world2LightNDC!

-One can create a rotation matrix using the x, y, z vectors as the columns. Eg: (u, v, -w) and (T, B, N).
MIT uses (N, B, T) for surfaces.

-For environment maps, -PI is not 0. Cannot scale and add like a linear transformation.

-In shadow maps, sampling the TextureArray requires not only uv, but which Mip level. Eg: (u, v, i), where i is spotlight
-Comparing distance should also be done AFTER perspective divide AND in "light" space. Using distance from hit point
to light in world space is very large, so everything becomes dark. Without perspective divide, values are not [0, 1].
